Summary of What This Method Does:
Reads a JSON file (using jsonPath and jsonKey), which contains multiple test cases.
For each test case in the JSON file:
It extracts and removes the scenarioName and statusCode from the JSON object.
It constructs an Object[] containing:
The modified JSON object (without the scenarioName and statusCode).
The scenarioName (or "Unnamed Scenario" if missing).
The statusCode (extracted from the JSON).
Returns a 2D array (Object[][]), where each row contains the test data for one test case.
This 2D array of test data is passed to the corresponding test method via the TestNG DataProvider mechanism, allowing each test to be run with different sets of data.

Example of How This Works in Practice:
Assume the JSON data looks like this:

[
    {
        "scenarioName": "Test 1",
        "statusCode": 200,
        "batchId": "1234"
    },
    {
        "scenarioName": "Test 2",
        "statusCode": 404,
        "batchId": "5678"
    }
]
The Object[][] returned by getData() will look like:

{
    {{"batchId": "1234"}, "Test 1", 200},
    {{"batchId": "5678"}, "Test 2", 404}
}
Each test method using this DataProvider will receive:

The JSON object: {"batchId": "1234"} for the first test, {"batchId": "5678"} for the second.
The scenario name: "Test 1" for the first test, "Test 2" for the second.
The expected status code: 200 for the first test, 404 for the second.
